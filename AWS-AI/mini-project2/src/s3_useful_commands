Here you can find usefult commands to check your S3 bucket status from your local terminal

1. List all buckets you own
```
aws s3api list-buckets --query 'Buckets[].Name'
```
2. Does the specific bucket exist & are you allowed to use it?
```
BUCKET=<your-old-bucket-name>
aws s3api head-bucket --bucket "$BUCKET" && echo "✅ Exists and you have access" || echo "❌ Not found or no access"

```

3. What region is it in? (keep it the same as your Studio/CLI region if possible)
```
aws s3api get-bucket-location --bucket "$BUCKET" --query 'LocationConstraint'
# Note: returns null for us-east-1
```

4. What’s inside right now?
```
aws s3 ls s3://$BUCKET/ --human-readable --summarize

```
If the name was deleted and grabbed by someone else, head-bucket may show 403.

5.Reusing it safely
 
Any time you want to reuse an old bucket, create project-scoped prefixes so projects don’t step on each other: 
```
export S3_PREFIX=mini-project2
aws s3api put-object --bucket "$BUCKET" --key "$S3_PREFIX/data/"
aws s3api put-object --bucket "$BUCKET" --key "$S3_PREFIX/artifacts/"
aws s3api put-object --bucket "$BUCKET" --key "$S3_PREFIX/metrics/"

```
Then set your env and run scripts against that prefix.

 6. To delete your project’s prefix:

```
aws s3 rm "s3://$BUCKET/$S3_PREFIX" --recursive
```
