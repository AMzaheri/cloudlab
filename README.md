# CloudLab

This repository documents my journey to becoming a cloud engineer.  
It follows the cloud engineer roadmap suggested in [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eroP2XGtTI).

## Phase 1: AWS Essentials
This phase focuses on building a strong foundation in cloud computing with AWS.

AWS work is organised under [`cloudlab/AWS`](AWS/README.md) and currently includes:
- AWS account setup with secure IAM admin user
- AWS CLI installation & configuration
- EC2 practice (launch, connect, cleanup) â€” CLI-only
- Upcoming: S3 static site mini-project (after completing Module 6 of AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials)
